# Cardinal

<p align="justify">
Cardinal is a modern and modular game engine designed to solve some <a href="wip">AAA game production issues</a>. 
The engine is fully written in C++17 and should be available on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
</p>

## The concept

<p align="justify">
The concept behind Cardinal is simple : <b>Providing a core engine from which you can develop your own engine adapted to your needs</b>. When working on a video game, it often happens that it becomes impossible to use a generic tool or a common game engine. For instance, you have some vehicles moving at high speed in a wide open-world and you need a super fast assets streaming system. Most game engines will fail. With Cardinal, <b>you develop you own systems and plug it to the core</b>, building a custom engine adapted to your game. You're free to use any third party library if you won't develop all by yourself. The core will include a common code base to most of video games, namely <b>containers, objects and entities, scripting systems etc</b>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  You might also be interested in Cardinal <b>if you wish to learn about engine programming</b>. For example you have interest for rendering or physics and you don't want recreate a whole engine ? Just download Cardinal and start writing your engine in a stable and functional environment.

## Expected engine features

<p align="justify">
Because the engine is still work in progress, here is a non-exhaustive list of what you could expect from Cardinal.
If you're interested in the development, check out the <a href="wip">roadmap</a>. 
</p>

* Full modular and data-oriented design
* Native Entity-Component System (ECS)
* Cutting edge job system and containers
* Native C++ scripting 
* Serialization and fast loading at light speed
* Small compile time
